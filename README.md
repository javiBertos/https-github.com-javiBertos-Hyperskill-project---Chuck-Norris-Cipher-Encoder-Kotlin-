# [Hyperskill project] Chuck Norris Cipher Encoder (Kotlin)
This project will allow us to deal with string and character variables and work with loops and conditional statements. Get familiar with the binary notation and data type conversion. Create an application for the unary representation and decoding of any text.

## About
Secret agents use encryption all the time. You know that everything can be encrypted as different characters. What about encryption that uses only one character and space? This method has a name — the Chuck Norris cipher. In this project, you will create a program that can encrypt any text into a sequence of zeros and spaces and decrypt this sequence into text.

## What you'll learn
Once you choose a project, we'll provide you with a study plan that includes all the necessary topics from your course to get it built. Here’s what awaits you:

#### Stage 1/5 Analyze the words
Learn to parse words and phrases into symbols.

#### Stage 2/5 The binary world
Learn how to convert characters into their binary representation.

#### Stage 3/5 Chuck Norris encrypts only with zeros
Learn how to encrypt any text with zeros and spaces.

#### Stage 4/5 Try to understand it
Create a program that can decrypt any text using only zeros and spaces.

#### Stage 5/5 Cooler than Chuck Norris
Create a program that can encrypt or decrypt text using only zeros and spaces.

## Training project
This project allows you to practice and strengthen your coding skills, helping you get ready for more advanced tasks ahead.
